ML_Techniques (jupyter notebook) : Alogorithms implemented
ML_PreProcess (jupyter notebook) : Pre processing code (This was shown during the first phase)
Final_Tags_Code.py : Balancing the data by removing extra rows and restricting the tags only to programming language 
Final_Tags.csv : CSV file (Data) used by the ML_Techniques (This file is to be used for implementing any algorithm)
Project.py : Algorithm implementation (Has same code as ML_Techniques) the only difference is that this file is not a jupter notebook
